  <string name="paragraph2">Fishkeepers use aquaria to keep fish, invertebrates, amphibians,
      \naquatic reptiles such as turtles, and aquatic plants. The term, coined by English naturalist
      \nPhilip Henry Gosse, combines the Latin root aqua, meaning water, with the suffix -arium,
      \nmeaning "a place for relating to".[1]

\n\nThe aquarium principle was fully developed in 1850 by the chemist Robert Warington, who explained
      \nthat plants added to water in a container would give off enough oxygen to support animals,
      \nso long as their numbers do not grow too large.[2] The aquarium craze was launched in early
      \nVictorian England by Gosse, who created and stocked the first public aquarium at the London
      \nZoo in 1853, and published the first manual, The Aquarium: An Unveiling of the Wonders of
      \nthe Deep Sea in 1854.[2]

\n\nDiving In Aquarium\' An aquarist owns fish or maintains an aquarium, typically constructed of
      glass or high-strength acrylic. Cuboid aquaria are also known as fish tanks or simply tanks,
      while bowl-shaped aquaria are also known as fish bowls. Size can range from a small glass bowl
      to immense public aquaria. Specialized equipment maintains appropriate water quality and other
      characteristics suitable for the aquarium's residents.
